# Background-LocationTracking-App
Home screen of app should contain a map screen. There should be two options: start shift and stop shift. When a person stops shift, you should plot user's shift on to shift off duration's location data on map. Please feel free to add any interesting feature to app. Click here for a screenshot mock up of what the final product should look like.
